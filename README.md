# Intro-PatternRec-ML
Here's my exercises for the course Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning at Tampere University 
Each exercise contains a pdf file(describing what is the problem), some Python files(solutions) and png files(showing the result).
In the beginning of the Python files, how the code works is explained.
